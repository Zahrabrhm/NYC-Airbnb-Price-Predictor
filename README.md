## Introduction
Understanding the optimal pricing strategy for an Airbnb listing can be challenging. This project seeks to address this issue by implementing various machine learning methods to predict the per-night listing price for properties in New York City. Hosts can leverage these predictions to set competitive and reasonable prices, ultimately enhancing their chances of attracting guests.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the [AB_NYC_2019 dataset](./Dataset/), which contains detailed information about Airbnb listings in New York City. This dataset is essential for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

## Methods
The following machine learning methods are implemented in this project:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Comprehensive analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the features and their relationships.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Utilization of the KNN algorithm to make predictions based on the similarity of neighboring data points.

### Decision Tree
- Implementation of a decision tree model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on relevant features.

### Linear Regression
- Application of linear regression for modeling the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

### Ridge Regression
- Introduction of Ridge Regression to address multicollinearity and improve the robustness of linear regression.

### Lasso Regression
- Implementation of Lasso Regression to encourage sparsity and feature selection.

### Ensemble Learning
- Using ensemble learning techniques for improved predictive performance.
